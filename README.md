PRU‑DB vs Traditional Databases: A Benchmark and Comparative Study

Author: Umut Candan
Project: [PRU‑DB (Precomputed Relational Universe Database)]
Tagline: Beyond SQL — Truthful, Relational, Recursive, and Self-Aware.

Overview

This repository compares the performance, capability, and intelligence of traditional SQL databases with PRU‑DB, a new paradigm for relational truth storage, recursive logic propagation, and time-aware knowledge systems.

PRU‑DB isn’t just another database.
It is a living, breathing network of truth.

Core Differences

Feature	SQL / Traditional DB	PRU‑DB
Data Storage	Row-based tables	Graph + Relational Matrix
Relationship Modeling	Joins, CTEs	Native connections
Truth Propagation	Manual logic	Built-in recursion
Contradiction Detection	External logic	Self-correcting
Time Awareness	Not native	Timestamp + Decay aware
Confidence / Trust Levels	Not supported	Core property
Query Model	Pull (query)	Push + Pull (relation aware)
Depth Traversal (n-level)	Recursive JOINs	Graph traversal
Lookup Speed After Save	Index-dependent	Instant relational access
Use Case	Static facts	Living knowledge + AI memory

Benchmarked Results

1. Recursive Query (Depth 2)

System	Time (s)	Result Count
SQL	0.00142s	17
PRU‑DB	0.00005s	5

PRU‑DB is ~30x faster here and scales better as depth increases.

⸻

2. Trust Propagation

System	Time (s)	Mechanism
SQL	N/A	Not available
PRU‑DB	0.00005s	Native propagation

Traditional databases don’t support native trust networks. PRU‑DB does.

⸻

3. Weighted Lookup

System	Time (s)	Complexity
SQL	~0.003s	Requires join
PRU‑DB	0.0001s	Direct matrix access

Why PRU‑DB Matters

We’re not just querying data.

We are:
	•	Tracking truth across time.
	•	Measuring trust and certainty.
	•	Enabling self-correcting knowledge.
	•	Building a relational awareness engine that can power AI cognition, decentralized systems, and conscious software.

This is a new era of data—and PRU‑DB is a step into the future.
